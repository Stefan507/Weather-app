# Weather App
This is a Python application that retrieves and displays weather information for a given location. It uses the PySimpleGUI library for the GUI interface, the requests library for making API requests, the geopy library for geocoding, and the OpenWeatherMap API for retrieving weather data.

## Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
Install the required dependencies:

pip install PySimpleGUI requests geopy
Sign up for an API key at OpenWeatherMap and replace YOUR_API_KEY in the get_weather_info function with your actual API key.

## Usage
To run the application, execute the following command:

python weather_app.py
The application will prompt you to enter a location. After entering the location, it will retrieve the weather information and display it in a GUI window.
